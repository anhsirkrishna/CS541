# CS541 - Custom 3D graphics engine using OpenGL || DigiPen Institute of Technology Â© 2022

Custom 3D graphics engine using OpenGL. I implement several features using a multi pass rendering pipeline:
1) Lighting using both Phong and BRDF algorithms. 
2) Shadows achieved with variance shadow maps. 
3) Reflections implemented with reflection maps. 
4) Texture rendering with normal maps. 
5) Image based lighting. 
6) Tone mapping and gamma correction.
7) Deferred shading with many local lights.
